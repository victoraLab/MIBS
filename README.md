# MIBS (Multiwell Incidence-based sequencing)


Multiwell Incidence-based sequencing (MIBS) is a methodology used by our group in the article "Tunable dynamics of B cell clonal selection in gut-associated germinal centers" (Nowosad & Mesin et al. 2020) to detect clonal expansions within, and repertoire overlap between mice by amplifying Igh rearrangements by PCR in multiple 100-cell pools. The pipeline we used for analysis of this type of data can be found here.
